# PopularMovies
This is Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree project.

### Getting Started
This app uses The Movie Database API. Create your API_KEY from https://www.themoviedb.org/.
After you get your own API_KEY, add this ```APIKEY = "Your Api Key"``` inside of "PopularMovies/gradle.properties".
If the file doesn't exist, create a new file and name it gradle.properties.
